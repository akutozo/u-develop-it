_______________________________________________________________________________


INSERT INTO tablename (first text, second text, INT, etc...)
VALUES ('first text' , 'second text', INT) -< this will add data to the table.

SELECT * FROM (table) will pull all information from the table.

SELECT first_text, second_text FROM table; would pull JUST requested colums from table

SELECT first_text, second_text
FROM table
WHERE indentifier = 1; would pull JUST those 2 columns IF the 3 had matching values.

UPDATE table
SET selection = 1
WHERE id = 3; would edit the selected information to 1, in this example, to the unique id 3

DELETE FROM candidates
WHERE first_name = "Montague";

.headers on
.mode column
